roadmap for language learning

tracking user's difficulties (profiles, database, tracking previous progress) and personalizing questions
also calculating statistics (how memory user has ? how often one should remind him words which were not asked recently ? performance vs frequency)
github pipeline for running pytest (and mypy) and updating requirements.txt
github packages, docker, pylint https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/
web app with a few endpoints as a counterparts for runnable scripts ?
"how to use it" should be available in "help" option for all modules
